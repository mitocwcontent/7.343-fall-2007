Assignment 1 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/paper1))

Paper 2
-------

Using the general subject of your own research projects, identify an area in which altered ROS levels or oxidative stress may be playing a critical physiological role. Based on this, write a 2-3 page double-spaced project proposal which should include the following:

*   An introduction to the area of interest and why ROS may be playing a critical role
*   The question you wish to pose
*   The experimental strategies (with descriptions of the appropriate controls) utilized to answer the proposed question
*   Possible outcomes and a brief discussion of what these might imply
*   A brief comment on how your studies might impact the development of therapeutic strategies in the pathology you're studying

Your final presentation should also be broken up along similar categories - please make sure that your talk is no more than 15 minutes, with5 additional minutes for questions.

Your introductory paragraphs should be submitted for critique and suggestions regarding the final paper and presentation.
