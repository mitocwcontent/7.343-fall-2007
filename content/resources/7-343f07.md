description: The pathway linking ROS production by NADPH oxidases (Nox) and TNFalpha
  pathway. The best evidence for ROS in normal physiological functioning comes from
  the existence of Nox, whose function is to produce controlled bursts of oxygen radicals.
  Nox enzyme function is particularly useful in immune cells in which the oxygen radical
  production is used to activate proteases to kill invading bacteria and other pathogens.
