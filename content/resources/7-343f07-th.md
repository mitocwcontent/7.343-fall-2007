  caption: The pathway linking ROS production by NADPH oxidases (Nox) and TNFalpha
    pathway. The best evidence for ROS in normal physiological functioning comes from
    the existence of Nox, whose function is to produce controlled bursts of oxygen
    radicals. Nox enzyme function is particularly useful in immune cells in which
    the oxygen radical production is used to activate proteases to kill invading bacteria
    and other pathogens. (Courtesy of Elsevier, Inc., [ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/).
